Prelimiary review of the JavaScript book "JavaScript Interview Questions"

---

A few weeks ago I pre-ordered a wonderful book,
<a href="http://o2js.com/interview-questions/" target="_blank">JavaScript Interview Questions</a>,
written by
<a href="http://o2js.com/volkan" target="_blank">Volkan Özçelik</a>.
So even though the book is not yet finished I thought I would take a moment
to give a brief overview of what I have read so far.

When I started reading the book it was a mere 20-30 pages long and most of the
book was empty chapters and sections outlining the structure of the soon to be
full copy. Now, just a few weeks further along, Volkan has begun filling in the
others sections nicely and the book has reached over 150 pages and there is still
much more work to do. This book will cover every topic surrounding a professional
JavaScript interview, from how to handle technical JavaScript interview questions
to even how to apply for a job and react to a job offer.

This book provides an intimate and in-depth look into the heart of JavaScript and
the parts that make the language unique from others. As if he felt years of
professional and tried experience were not enough Volkan also offers various
resources and links to related material throughout the book to help support points
he makes, as well as to provide an alternative point of view to the topics he is
covering. So far the references section of the book takes up 5 pages and includes
over 100 unique links, and there are more to come.

For those who feel that this book is just for those looking how to get a leg up in
a JavaScript interview, please reconsider purchasing the book. It will help you
learn the hidden secrets to make you a better JavaScript developer and an all
around better interviewee.
