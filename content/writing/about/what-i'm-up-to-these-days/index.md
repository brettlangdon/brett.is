It has been awhile since I have written anything in my blog. Might as well get started
somewhere, like a brief summary of what I have been working on lately.

It has been far too long since I last wrote in this blog. I always have these aspirations
of writing all the time about all the things I am working on. The problem generally comes
back to me not feeling confident enough to write about anything I am working on. "Oh, a
post like that probably already exists", "There are smarter people than me out there
writing about this, why bother". It is an unfortunate feeling to try and get over.

So, here is where I am making an attempt. I will try to write more, it'll be healthy for
me. I always hear of people setting reminders in their calendars to block off time to
write blog posts, even if they end up only writing a few sentences, which seems like a
great idea that I indent to try.

Ok, enough with the "I haven't been feeling confident dribble", on to what I actually have
been up to lately.

Since my last post I have a new job. I am now Senior Software Engineer at
[underdog.io](https://underdog.io/). We are a small early stage startup (4 employees, just
over a year old) that is in the hiring space. For candidates our site basically acts like
a common application to now over 150 venture backed startups in New York City or San
Francisco. In the short time I have been working there, I am very impressed and glad that
I took their offer. I work with some awesome and smart people and I am still learning a
lot, whether it is about coding or just trying to run a business.

I originally started to end this post by talking about a programming project I have been
working on, but it ended up being 4 times longer than the text above and have decided
instead to write a separate post about it. Apparently even though I have been writing
lately, I have a lot to say.

Thanks for bearing with this "I have to write something" post. I am not going to make a
promise that I am going to write more, because it is something that could easily fall
through, like it usually does... but I shall give it my all!
